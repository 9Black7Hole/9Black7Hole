## Hi everyone! I'm 9Black7Hole. ðŸ‘‹

About Me:
I am a Computer Science student, currently halfway through my degree, I am expanding my knowledge in high performance computing, and front-end and back-end development. I have research experience as a student researcher working on computational biology and bioinformatics, and my goal is to strengthen my development skills and explore new technologies. I love to learn and build something innovative, creative, and most importantly, interactive!
